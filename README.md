## Interpretability of Deep Learning methods in Carotid Artery Image Classification & Segmentation

In this thesis, we explored the interpretability of Deep Learning methods applied to Medical Imagery classficiation and Segmentation. 
That is to say, the "human understandability" of the decision taken during the classification and segmentation of carotid artery ultrasound images, used to detect atherosclerosis (a know symptom of cardio vascular disease).
Our results suggest that these Deep Learning methods have a solid basis to be commonly understood, and as such could be used for the automation of plaque detection and IMT calculations.

### Datsets:
* [REGICOR](https://www.regicor.org)
* GT labels generated by segmentating the images into 2 or 6 labels

### Interpretability methods
* [SHAP values] (https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
* [Grid saliency] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.13054)

### Implementation
The entire code was created in Python 3.
For the classification of the plaque we used [keras](https://github.com/keras-team/keras) running tensorflow on the backend.
For the segmentation and grid saliency, we used a pytorch backend.
